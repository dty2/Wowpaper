## What is a Wallpaper List?

Essentially, it's a directory for storing multiple wallpapers.

Similar to playlists in streaming music software.

This software organizes and plays wallpapers using wallpaper lists.

## Can there only be one wallpaper list?

Yes, there can be multiple.

For example, creating wallpaper lists "aaa", "bbb", and "ccc" in `$HOME/.config/wow`

```bash
cd $HOME/.config/wow/
mkdir aaa bbb ccc
```

## Can wallpaper lists be created in other directories?

Yes, you can force the directory location of a wallpaper list to be specified in the configuration file.

Therefore, it can be placed in any directory; it doesn't have to be under `$HOME/.config/wow`.

## Can wallpaper lists be scattered?

Yes, you can force the directory location of a wallpaper list to be specified in the configuration file.

Therefore, it's not required that all wallpaper lists be placed in the same directory.

That is, the following effect can be achieved:

- Wallpaper list xxx is in the `$HOME/.config/wow` directory
- Wallpaper list yyy is in the `$HOME/y/` directory
- Wallpaper list zzz is in the `$HOME/z/` directory
